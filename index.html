      <h1>Hi, my name is Brendan,</h1>
      <h2>This is my story.</h2>
      <p>I am making this website not only for a lab in my cis-137 class, but also as
        a portfolio/blog of my progress through computer science. This will eventually
        include my personaly projects, possible links to github, and just useful tips
        I learn throughout my education.</p>

          <p>I started learning about programming in 2017. I wanted to be able to make a game
            much like runescape and league of legends. I never thought that I would take interest
            in much else besides games when it came to programming.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="item2">
          <img src="java.png">
          <p>My very first course in programming was intro to java. I really liked
            the idea of learning java because Runescape was coded entirely in java.
            Once I started to get the hang of the basics, I took on a lot of personal projects.</p>

        <div class="item3">
          <img src="python.jpg">
          <p>After learning java basics, I am now enrolled in an intro to python course.
            I was fairly skeptical at first about taking to Python, and was more there
            just because it was a requirement. However, after learning some of the real-world uses
            I have become more open to the possibilities I can accomplish using Python.</p>
