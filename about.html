          <p>My name is Brendan Henry, I am a sophomore at Carroll Community College studying Computer Science.
          I was originally going for a degree in mechanical engineering, but found that CS was more for me.
          I enjoy playing instruments and gaming. I currently know how to play the guitar, piano, drums,
          saxophone, and am learning how to sing. I hope to one day work at a major gaming company and
          develop a game that I would enjoy playing. Honestly, any job in the programming field would
          be pretty awesome in my opinion.</p>
